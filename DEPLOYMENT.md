## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Smart Contracts to Testnet

#### 1.1 Generate Deployment Plan
```bash
cd /workspaces/Stockify
clarinet deployments generate --testnet
```

#### 1.2 Review Deployment Plan
```bash
cat deployments/default.testnet-plan.yaml
```

Verify:
- [ ] Correct contract names
- [ ] Proper deployment order
- [ ] Sufficient STX balance for fees

#### 1.3 Execute Deployment
```bash
clarinet deployments apply -p deployments/default.testnet-plan.yaml
```

#### 1.4 Record Contract Addresses
After deployment, note the contract addresses:
```
stockify-core: ST.....................stockify-core
stock-token: ST.....................stock-token
sip-010-trait: ST.....................sip-010-trait
```

#### 1.5 Verify on Explorer
- [ ] Visit https://explorer.hiro.so/?chain=testnet
- [ ] Search for each contract address
- [ ] Verify deployment success
- [ ] Check contract code is correct

---

### Step 2: Configure Frontend

#### 2.1 Update Environment Variables
Edit `frontend/.env.local`:
```env
# Update with your deployed contract addresses
NEXT_PUBLIC_STOCKIFY_CONTRACT=ST1234...YOUR_ADDRESS.stockify-core
NEXT_PUBLIC_DSTOCK_CONTRACT=ST1234...YOUR_ADDRESS.stock-token

# Optional: Add OpenAI key for enhanced AI
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...your_key_here

# Network settings (already configured)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STACKS_NETWORK=testnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_HIRO_API=https://api.testnet.hiro.so
```

#### 2.2 Update Contract References
If needed, update contract addresses in:
- [ ] `src/lib/stacksClient.ts`
- [ ] Any hardcoded references

#### 2.3 Test Locally
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npm run start
```

Test all features:
- [ ] Wallet connection
- [ ] Balance checking
- [ ] Stock purchase
- [ ] Stock sale
- [ ] Portfolio display
- [ ] Transaction history
- [ ] Logout functionality

---

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend to Vercel

#### 3.1 Prepare Repository
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for deployment"
git push origin main
```

#### 3.2 Import to Vercel
1. [ ] Go to https://vercel.com
2. [ ] Click "New Project"
3. [ ] Import your GitHub repository
4. [ ] Configure settings:
   - **Framework Preset**: Next.js
   - **Root Directory**: `frontend`
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `.next`

#### 3.3 Add Environment Variables in Vercel
In Vercel project settings, add:
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_STOCKIFY_CONTRACT`
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_DSTOCK_CONTRACT`
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACKS_NETWORK`
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_HIRO_API`
- [ ] `OPENAI_API_KEY` (optional)

#### 3.4 Deploy
- [ ] Click "Deploy"
- [ ] Wait for build to complete
- [ ] Verify deployment success

#### 3.5 Test Production Deployment
Visit your Vercel URL and test:
- [ ] Page loads correctly
- [ ] Wallet connects
- [ ] Can read from contracts
- [ ] Can execute transactions
- [ ] All features work

---

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Configuration

#### 4.1 Initialize Contract State
If needed, set initial prices (as contract owner):
```bash
# Use Clarinet console or Stacks Explorer
# Call: (contract-call? .stockify-core set-price "AAPL" u175000000)
```

#### 4.2 Test with Real Users
- [ ] Share URL with test users
- [ ] Have them connect wallets
- [ ] Execute test trades
- [ ] Verify all transactions on Explorer

#### 4.3 Monitor Initial Activity
- [ ] Check Stacks Explorer for transactions
- [ ] Monitor Vercel logs for errors
- [ ] Watch for any user feedback

2. [ ] Deploy fixed version
3. [ ] Migrate state if necessary
4. [ ] Update frontend to use new contract

### Frontend
1. [ ] Revert to previous deployment in Vercel
2. [ ] Fix issues locally

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Contract Calls Fail
**Solution:**
- Verify contract address in `.env.local`
- Check user has sufficient STX balance

- Verify function parameters are correct

### Issue: Wallet Won't Connect
**Solution:**
- Check wallet extension is installed
- Verify wallet is on testnet network
- Try different wallet (Hiro vs Leather)
- Clear browser cache

### Issue: Transactions Don't Appear
**Solution:**
- Wait for block confirmation (~10 minutes)
- Refresh transaction history
- Check Stacks Explorer directly
- Verify transaction was broadcast

### Issue: Prices Not Updating
